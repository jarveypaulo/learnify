                    <li>
                        The materials on Learnify's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Learnify makes no warranties, 
                        expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without 
                        limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,

                    In no event shall Learnify or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages 
                    for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use
